# Contributing

First and foremost, thanks for the help, I appreciate all of the contributions, and the awesome-zsh-plugins list wouldn't be nearly as complete without them.

## To add to the list:

### Submit a pull request.

* Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
* The list is split into sections for frameworks, plugins, themes and completions, please add your entries to the appropriate sections. If an entry is a plugin that provides both plugin functionality and tab completions, add it to the plugins section. The completions section is meant for projects that only provide extra tab completions.
* Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line, with capitalization consistent with the other entries in the section.
* For consistency, please use all caps for ZSH in the descriptions.
* Each entry should be a single line. This makes keeping the sections sorted easier. We let the GitHub formatter handle adding any required line breaks rather than embedding breaks in the lines ourselves.
* Each entry should be limited to one link, and that link should be the first part of the line. It is ok to submit more than one entry in a PR.
* If you're submitting a theme, please make sure that the theme repo has a screen shot so that list users can tell what it looks like before installing it.
* Please make sure all framework, plugin, themes or completions list entries are sorted *alphabetically*.
* Please make sure all new framework, plugin, themes or completions entries have a license file. Some users are particular about the code they use and want to be sure they are compliant with licensing, make sure it's easy for them to determine what the license is.
* The link should be named the name of the package or project.
* Your PR should pass the Travis checks. If the travis checks show an error that you didn't add (a previous plugin entry has gone 404, for example) you don't _have_ to fix those errors, though I'll certainly appreciate the help if you do, or you create an issue documenting the problem so I can fix it.
* It is fine to have multiple new entries in a single PR.
* No need to squash commits. It is fine to have multiple commits in a PR.

## To remove an entry:

Open an issue to discuss why the entry should be removed, and optionally create a PR.
